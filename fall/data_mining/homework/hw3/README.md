# Project 3: Link Analysis
The aim of this project  is to implement the PageRank, HITS, and 
SimRank algorithms on the provided graphs.

The final report should include:
1. Implementation details.
2. Result analysis and discussion.
3. Computation performance analysis.
4. Discussion (what you learned from this project and other comments).

Some other questions for discussion ( def should do):
- More limitations about link analysis of algorithms (scalability, etc...?0
- Do these algorithms really find the "important" webpages?
- What are some practical issues (performance considerations) when using these algorithms on the real web?
- What are the results for the actor/movie graph and what do they say?
- New ideas about the algorithm?
- What is the effect of the *C* parameter in SimRank?
- Any new measurement we can use for similarity measurement?
