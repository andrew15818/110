# Project 3: Link Analysis
The aim of this project  is to implement the PageRank, HITS, and 
SimRank algorithms on the provided graphs.

The code for the algorithms is in the `algos/` folder.
To see the options, run

```sh
python main.py -h
```

The most common run case would include the `-f` option for an input file and the `-a`
option for a specific algorithm, e.g.

```sh
python main.py -a pagerank -f data/hw3dataset/graph_1.txt
```
