# Data Mining Homework 2
The purpose of this homework assignment is to understand what classification systems do 
and the difference between real behavior of classfication model and observed data.

This is done by creating a classification model that observes that difference.

# General Procedure
We need to design a set of rules that can classify the data points.
It should have:
	- k features
	- 'absolutely right' data which we can use to generate our positive/negative data

We need a minimum of a decision tree, but we can add our other model (NN?)

Tentative plan: 
1. Decision Tree
2. Bayes Classifier
3. Nearest Neighbors
4. NN
5. Support Vector Machines?
