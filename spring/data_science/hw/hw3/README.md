# Data Science Homework 3
The goal of this assignment is to practice data imputation and
deletion techniques when dealing with incomplete data to our
supervised models, then using it for a regression task.

The `data` directory contains nine common datasets each with
some missing features.

## Method
We have to randomly remove a certain percentage of the 
dataset features (e.g. 10%, 30%, 70%) and test each 
imputation method 5 times with different seeds.
