# Optimization Design Homework 2
For hw2, we practice the zero and first order optimization methods such as 
golden section search, Hooke-Jeeves, and Nelder-Mead to optimize 
functions programatically.

Since we have to plot the values of our function as we find optimal
parameters, I am thinking of using Python just for the ease of 
plotting.
